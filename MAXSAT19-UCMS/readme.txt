Runtimes from MaxSAT Evaluation 2019, unweighted complete track.
I exluded RC2-2018 solver since it wasn't useful for our 
experiments. 
The data does not distinguish between timeout, memout and crashes. 

Instance features were extracted with SATzilla feature computation software: 
http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/Projects/SATzilla/
because I couldn't find a MaxSAT instance feature extractor.
