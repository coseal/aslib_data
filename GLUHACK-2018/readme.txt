This is a Glucose Hack Subtract of SAT18 competition. 
I created this scenario by subsetting SAT18-EXP 
scenario. 

There is no information concerning feature time, memout, crashes.
The data does not distinguish between timeout, memout and crashes. 
Not all instances from SAT18 competition are included in scenario. 
I excluded instances for which I couldn't extract instance features
due to timeout or memout.
