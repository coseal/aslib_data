Results from the paper "Don't Rule Out Simple Models Prematurely: A Large Scale
Benchmark Comparing Linear and Non-linear Classifiers in OpenML". For many
datasets in the OpenML100, linear models are compared against non-linear models.
This scenario contains for each dataset the following runs:
- SVM (Linear vs. Rbf-kernel)
- Neural Network (Perceptron vs. MultiLayerPerceptron)
- Decision Tree (Stump vs. Tree)
Hyperparameters were optimizid using Random Search. If it did not terminate
within 5 days, the run was excluded. 

In our study, we compared classifiers from a single class against each other
(e.g., Perceptron vs. MultiLayerPerceptron). To reproduce these results, the
scenario should be subsampled. Of course, it is also valid to select the best
across all 6 classifiers.
